# techisb.de

This repo hosts the code and configuration for the [techisb.de website](https://techisb.de) that collects events, meetups, workshops, and conferences in Berlin, Germany that matter (at least to us). It is inspired by the infamous [techism.de](http://techism.de) site that was started in Munich and which served us well at the time and the place.
